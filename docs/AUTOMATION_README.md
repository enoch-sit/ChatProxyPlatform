## 🚀 Quick Start

### For Fresh Installations

Simply run:
```cmd
automated_setup.bat
```

**What it does**:
1. ✅ Scans system (Docker, Python, Git, drives)
2. ✅ Configures Docker volumes on optimal drive
3. ✅ Starts Flowise
4. ⚠️ **Prompts you for Flowise API key** (only user input required)
5. ✅ Configures all services with synchronized secrets
6. ✅ Starts auth, accounting, proxy, and bridge services
7. ✅ Creates admin user with 10,000 credits
8. ✅ Creates 3 teachers (5,000 credits each)
9. ✅ Creates 5 students (1,000 credits each)
10. ✅ Verifies entire system
11. ✅ Displays success message with next steps

**Time**: 10-15 minutes  
**User input**: Just the Flowise API key

## 📋 What Problems Were Solved

### Summary from DEBUGGING_PROGRESS.md

We debugged and fixed **7 major issues**:

1. **Drive Space Crisis** ⚠️ CRITICAL
   - C: drive had only 1GB free
   - Automated migration to D: drive (1.9TB free)

2. **MongoDB Connection Failures** 🗄️
   - auth-service using wrong volume path
   - flowise-proxy wrong password
   - Both fixed in automation

3. **JWT Secret Mismatch** 🔐 CRITICAL
   - Services couldn't authenticate each other
   - Now auto-generated and synchronized

4. **Email Verification Field** 📧
   - Code used `isVerified`, DB had `emailVerified`
   - Fixed in user creation automation

5. **Missing package-lock.json** 📦
   - Docker builds failed
   - Now runs `npm install` automatically

6. **User Credit Initialization** 💰
   - Users had no credits after creation
   - Now automatically allocated via API

7. **API Endpoint Discovery** 🔍
   - Found correct endpoints for all operations
   - Documented in SYSTEM_STATUS.md

**Result**: System now works reliably from fresh install to production-ready!
