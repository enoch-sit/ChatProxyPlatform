## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

Before creating bug reports, please check the existing issues to avoid duplicates.

**When submitting a bug report, include:**
- Clear title and description
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Screenshots if applicable
- System information:
  ```bash
  check_system.bat  # Run this and include the report
  ```
- Service logs:
  ```bash
  docker logs [service-name] --tail 50
  ```

### Suggesting Enhancements

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as GitHub issues. When creating an enhancement suggestion, include:
- Clear title and description
- Use case and motivation
- Expected behavior
- Alternative solutions considered
- Impact on existing functionality

### Pull Requests

**Before submitting a pull request:**

1. **Fork the repository** and create your branch from `test/localdeploy`
2. **Test your changes** thoroughly:
   ```bash
   check_system.bat  # Verify system health
   ```
3. **Update documentation** if you changed functionality
4. **Follow existing code style** (see below)
5. **Write clear commit messages**

Branch policy:

- Use [docs/BRANCHING_POLICY.md](docs/BRANCHING_POLICY.md) as the source of truth for branch roles and naming.
- New feature work starts from `test/localdeploy`.
- `bhss` and `release/aws-prod-candidate` are production-class promotion targets, not primary feature-authoring branches.
- `bhss` is the live Windows + Docker Desktop deployment line.

**Pull Request Process:**

1. Update the README.md with details of changes if needed
2. Update the documentation in `docs/` folder if applicable
3. The PR will be merged once you have approval from maintainers

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Windows 10/11
- Docker Desktop
- Python 3.x
- Node.js 18+ (for service development)
- Git

### Initial Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ThankGodForChatProxyPlatform.git
   cd ThankGodForChatProxyPlatform
   ```

2. **Check system prerequisites:**
   ```bash
   check_system.bat
   ```

3. **Follow deployment plan:**
   - See [DEPLOYMENT_PLAN.md](DEPLOYMENT_PLAN.md)

### Development Workflow

Branch workflow:

1. Create a short-lived branch from `test/localdeploy` using `feat/...`, `fix/...`, `hotfix/...`, `refactor/...`, `chore/...`, `ops/...`, or `spike/...`.
2. Implement the feature against the Docker-managed local stack on this Windows machine, typically via `python local-deploy.py`.
3. Validate the full feature bundle against the local containers.
4. Merge back into `test/localdeploy`.
5. Promote the same tested commit set to `bhss` for the Windows + Docker Desktop production line.
6. Promote the same tested commit set to `release/aws-prod-candidate` for the AWS production line.

**Start services in development mode:**

```bash
# Auth Service (with hot reload)
cd auth-service
npm install
npm run dev

# Accounting Service (with hot reload)
cd accounting-service
npm install
npm run dev

# Flowise Proxy (with hot reload)
cd flowise-proxy-service-py
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn app.main:app --reload

# Bridge UI (with hot reload)
cd bridge
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Code Style

**JavaScript/TypeScript:**
- Use Prettier for formatting
- Follow ESLint rules
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Async/await over callbacks

**Python:**
- Follow PEP 8 style guide
- Use type hints
- Use FastAPI best practices
- Format with Black

**General:**
- Clear, descriptive variable names
- Comment complex logic
- Write self-documenting code
- Keep functions small and focused

### Testing

**Before submitting PR, ensure:**

1. **All services start successfully:**
   ```bash
   check_system.bat
   ```

2. **Manual testing:**
   - Login as admin, teacher, and student
   - Test chatflow interaction
   - Verify credit tracking
   - Check token refresh (wait 50+ minutes)

3. **Service-specific tests:**
   ```bash
   # Auth Service
   cd auth-service
   npm test

   # Accounting Service
   cd accounting-service
   npm test

   # Flowise Proxy
   cd flowise-proxy-service-py
   pytest
   ```

### Documentation

- Adding new features
- Changing API endpoints
- Modifying configuration
- Adding dependencies

**Documentation files:**
- `README.md` - Main overview
- `DEPLOYMENT_PLAN.md` - Installation guide
- `SETUP_GUIDE.md` - Configuration reference
- `docs/SERVICE_ARCHITECTURE.md` - Architecture details
